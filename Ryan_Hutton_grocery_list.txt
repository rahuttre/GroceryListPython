# Date:  2 February 2019

# Prompt: Your task for this project is to create a very simple grocery list script. 
# This script emphasizes the importance of using lists, dictionaries, and loop types
# within your script, and how the use of those functions shapes your approach to 
# creating a script.

# Creating an empty dictionary and list, respectively, to be updated later.
grocery_item = {}
grocery_history = []

stop = 'go'

while (stop != 'q' or stop != 'Q'):   
  item_name = input("Item name:\n")
  quantity = input("Quantity purchased:\n")
  cost = input("Price per item:\n")
  
  # Adding each item collected from the user to the dictionary, 'grocery_item'.
  # The user inputs are stored in the dictionary according to their key value and
  # and value type, and the dictionary is updated. Each item is then added to the 
  # grocery_history list via the append() function.  This entire process is iterated 
  # through a while loop to repeat the process if the user decides to continue, otherwise, the loop quits.
  grocery_item = {'name':item_name, 'number':int(quantity), 'price':float(cost)}
  grocery_history.append(grocery_item)
  
  program_control = input("Would you like to enter another item?\nType 'c' for continue or 'q' to quit:\n")
  
  # 'program_control' above accepts user input and is used to modify the global variable, stop.
  # Again, if the user inputs 'c', the process repeats itself, otherwise, quit this step.
  if (program_control == 'c' or program_control == 'C'):
    stop = program_control
    continue
  else:
    stop = program_control
    break

grand_total = 0

# A for loop is used to iterate throgh the length of the grocery_history list.  Each item's
# total is calculated by accessing the grocery_history's ith element and its key values 
# (number/quantity and price).  This item total is then added to the grand_total.  Each
# grocery item is printed out and its total.  grand_total is printed out as the last step.
for i in range(0, len(grocery_history)):  
  item_total = (grocery_history[i]['number'] * grocery_history[i]['price'])
  grand_total += item_total
  
  print(grocery_history[i]['number'], grocery_history[i]['name'], "@ $%.2f" % + grocery_history[i]['price'], "ea $%.2f" % + item_total)
  
  item_total = 0

print("Grand total: $%.2f" % + grand_total)
